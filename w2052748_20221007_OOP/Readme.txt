Ticketing System Report
Introduction
The Ticketing System is a software application designed to manage the sale and distribution of event tickets. It allows multiple vendors to release tickets into a common pool, from which customers can retrieve and purchase tickets. The system is built to handle concurrent interactions between vendors and customers, with real-time updates on ticket availability. The design focuses on scalability, ensuring that the system can handle varying numbers of users without performance degradation.

System Architecture
The system consists of several core components:

Ticket Pool: The central repository where tickets are stored and managed.

Vendor: Entities that release tickets into the Ticket Pool at a defined rate.

Customer: Entities that retrieve tickets from the Ticket Pool, also at a defined rate.

Main Application Logic: Manages the interactions between vendors, customers, and the ticket pool, including the flow of tickets in and out of the pool.

UI Interface: Provides a simple, intuitive interface for configuration and monitoring of events, including buttons to start/stop the event, release tickets, and view logs.

Functional Requirements
Multiple Vendors: The system allows multiple vendors to release tickets into the pool at configurable rates.

Multiple Customers: Customers can retrieve tickets from the pool at a defined rate.

Concurrency Handling: The system can handle simultaneous ticket releases and purchases without conflicts.

Real-Time Ticket Management: The system ensures that tickets are updated in real-time, allowing customers to see available tickets at any given time.

Configurability: The event parameters, such as ticket pool size, ticket release rate, and retrieval rate, can be configured by the user.

System Design and Architecture
Class Diagram
The primary classes in the system include:

TicketPool: Manages the tickets, including adding and removing tickets from the pool.

Vendor: Releases tickets into the pool at a specified rate.

Customer: Purchases tickets from the pool, also at a specific rate.

MainApplication: Orchestrates the flow of operations, controls the interaction between customers, vendors, and the ticket pool, and updates the UI.

Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the main components:

Ticket Release by Vendor: Vendors release tickets into the pool at a given rate, updating the pool accordingly.

Ticket Retrieval by Customer: Customers query the pool for available tickets and purchase them if they are available. The system processes these transactions concurrently to allow multiple customers to interact with the pool at the same time.

Testing and Results
Test Scenarios
Simultaneous Customer Purchases:

Test: Multiple customers try to purchase tickets at the same time.

Result: The system correctly manages concurrent ticket retrievals, ensuring each customer receives their allocated tickets without conflict.

Pass: Yes

Notes: No race conditions or errors observed during simultaneous interactions.

Ticket Pool Capacity Handling:

Test: Ensure that the system does not exceed the predefined capacity of the ticket pool.

Result: The system stops accepting tickets once the pool reaches its maximum capacity.

Pass: Yes

Notes: The pool correctly enforces the maximum capacity limit.

Vendor Ticket Release Rate:

Test: Verify that vendors can release tickets into the pool at the defined rate.

Result: Tickets are released into the pool at the specified rate.

Pass: Yes

Notes: The ticket release was smooth and met the specified rate.

Customer Ticket Retrieval Rate:

Test: Verify that customers retrieve tickets from the pool at the defined rate.

Result: Customers can retrieve tickets at the rate specified by the system configuration.

Pass: Yes

Notes: The retrieval rate was accurate and responsive.

Issues Found
Issue: No major issues were encountered during the tests. Minor issues related to UI responsiveness were noted but did not affect the functionality.

Resolution: The UI responsiveness issue was addressed by optimizing background processes that manage ticket release and retrieval.

UI Overview
The application interface consists of the following features:

Start/Stop Event Button: Allows users to start and stop the event, enabling and disabling ticket release and retrieval.

View Logs Button: Displays a log of all ticket transactions, including details of tickets released and purchased.

Configuration Options: Users can configure the ticket pool size, ticket release rate, and retrieval rate.

The UI is designed for ease of use, with clear labels and intuitive controls to allow users to interact with the system smoothly.

Conclusion
The Ticketing System successfully meets all functional requirements, including handling concurrent interactions between vendors and customers, real-time ticket management, and configurable event parameters. All test cases passed, confirming the systemâ€™s robustness and reliability. The application provides a simple yet effective way for vendors to release tickets and for customers to retrieve them in a seamless and efficient manner.
